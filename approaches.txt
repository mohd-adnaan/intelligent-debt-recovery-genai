1. Profanity Detection
a. Identify all call IDs where collection agents have used profane language
b. Identify all call IDs where borrowers have used profane language

Approach 1: Pattern Matching (Regex)

Use a predefined list of profane(obscene) words and phrases.
Implement regex to detect occurrences of these words in the text field of the YAML files.

Approach 2: Machine Learning (Fine-Tuned LLM)

Use a pre-trained language model (llama) fine-tuned for profanity detection.
Fine-tune the model on a dataset containing labeled examples of profane and non-profane text.
Use the model to classify utterances as containing profanity or not.

2. Privacy and Compliance Analysis
Sensitive information includes balance, account details, etc.
Identity verification involves confirming date of birth, address, or Social Security Number (SSN).

Approach 1: Pattern Matching (Regex)

Use regex to detect sensitive information( balances, SIN, DOB)
Check if keywords (e.g., "date of birth", "dob", "address", "current address", "social security number") occurs before sharing sensitive information.
Approach 2: Machine Learning (Fine-Tuned LLM)

Fine-tune a language model to classify whether sensitive information is shared without proper verification.
Train the model on labeled examples of compliant and non-compliant conversations.

3. Call Quality Metrics Analysis

a. Calculate overtalk percentage per call

Overtalk occurs when both the agent and borrower are speaking simultaneously.
Calculate the total duration of overlapping speech (stime and etime fields) and divide by the total call duration.
b. Calculate silence percentage per call

Silence occurs when neither the agent nor the borrower is speaking.
Calculate the total duration of silence and divide by the total call duration.
Visualization Requirements

Create bar charts or pie charts to represent overtalk and silence percentages for each call.
Use libraries like matplotlib or seaborn for visualization.
